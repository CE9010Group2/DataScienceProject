# How Close Are NBS Students To Their Classmates?
*By Cheng Jin Yee and Jeremy Jerome Chia - CE9010 - 18 April 2018 (AY 1718 S2)*

## Introduction

This is a data science project that is prepared in fulfilment of the module requirements (*CE9010 - Introduction to Data Science*). This notebook will discuss the following:

* The Data - Problem, Acquisition and Exploration
* Pre-Processing and Data Analysis

This study drew samples solely from full-time undergraduate NTU students from Nanyang Business School (NBS). (henceforth referred to as *"NBS students"*)

### Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the people who have contributed to this study:

* Assoc. Prof. Xavier Bresson, for his guidance and materials which helped us in the development of this project.
* Participants of the Survey, who formed the basis of this study. Thank you for your inputs and for sharing your thoughts with us.

### Objective & The Data Problem
The aim of our study is to investigate if, and the extent to which, various factors will affect NBS students' perception of how close they are to their classmates. Regression is primarily the method used to determine this. This is because we aim to predict a closeness ranking value given the different factors.

By finding out what factors influence NBS students the most, we intend to use the discoveries from this study to develop the experience for the upcoming Freshmen Welcome Week in August 2018 in terms of groupings and opportunities for interaction, in a bid to give them a headstart in fostering closer friendships throughout their course of study in NBS.

This project goes through the following steps:
1) Data Acquisition
2) Data Exploration
3) Pre-Processing
4) Data Analysis
